# Rules

## 1. Introduction

This is the official rulebook of the 3 Digit World Cup ("3WC"). This document outlines all rules, procedures, and guidelines for participation.

The tournament organisers reserve the right to modify the rules at any moment as they see fit. Any changes to the rules will be communicated clearly to all participants.

## 2. General rules

1. All spaces affiliated with 3WC (including this page) are subject to the [osu! community rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Rules) as well as the rules of the respective platforms themselves.
2. Players are expected to uphold a competitive and friendly environment, and to treat tournament staff and other players with respect.
   - This includes keeping matches running smoothly and avoiding deliberate delays.
3. Any foul play, including but not limited to: cheating, bracket manipulation, or failure to cooperate in match rescheduling, is strictly prohibited.
4. Failure to abide by the tournament rules will be punished accordingly. Penalties for violating the tournament rules include, but are not limited to:
   - Exclusion of specific players for one beatmap.
   - Exclusion of specific players for an entire match.
   - Declaring the match as forfeited, or as a win by default for the other team.
   - Disqualification from the entire tournament.
   - Disqualification from the current and future tournaments in the series, until appealed.

## 3. Tournament rules

1. 3WC is a country-based 3 versus 3 team tournament, played on the osu! game mode.
2. The tournament begins with a qualifier stage, followed by a 16-team double-elimination bracket.
3. Beatmap scoring is based on ScoreV2.
4. The minimum size for a team is 3 players, and the maximum is 6.
5. The mappool, matchups, and match schedules will be announced by the tournament organisers on this site, as well as on the spreadsheet, on the Sunday before the matches take place.
   - These announcements may be delayed to ensure higher quality or to accommodate commentators for the mappool showcase. Any delays will be communicated clearly to all participants.
6. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable beatmap elements like storyboards and skins is allowed.
   - Custom skin elements must not be used to alter core gameplay elements or mechanics in unintended ways.
7. If less than the minimum amount of required players are present at match time, the match can be postponed for up to 10 minutes. If after this period there are still not enough players for either team, a win by default will be declared for the side with the most members present.
   - The minimum number of required players is the number of players needed to play a beatmap without any vacant spots in the lobby (i.e. at least 3 participants from each team must be present for the match to begin).
8. Exchanging players between individual games is allowed without limitations.
9. If a game ends in a draw, it will be nullified and the beatmap will be replayed.
10. Teams may ask for a rematch of a game if a team member encounters technical issues while playing within 30 seconds or 25% of the beatmap's drain time (whichever happens first) of the game's start. Referees may perform a rematch independently of either team if reasonable evidence of a disconnect/tech issue exists. Referees may veto any rematch requests at their discretion.
    - "Lag spikes", using the wrong skin, and similar, are not considered valid reasons to rematch a beatmap.
    - The roster for each team during a rematch must remain the same as the original run. If that is not possible, e.g. by virtue of a technical issue that prevents a player from entering the lobby, both teams will be allowed to swap rosters.
    - Misuse or abuse of this rule may lead to penalties being applied to the offending player or team.
11. If a player disconnects mid-game, common sense will be applied: if proof exists of the disconnected player's score (or a rough estimate of their hypothetical score if they finished the map), it will be added to their team's total score; if it is at all ambiguous, their score will be excluded from their team's total. Valid proof of a score includes but is not limited to:
    - Screenshots from other players taken directly in-game that show the affected player's score. These screenshots **MUST** be taken directly in-game with `Shift` + `F12`, that is, they must be hosted on the `https://osu.ppy.sh/` domain.
    - Player point-of-view live stream snippets (commonly referred to as "clips" or "VODs"). The entirety of the play, along with the results screen must be clearly visible along with the affected player's score.
    - Replay files of the play, taken directly from the "Local scores" tab on the affected player's client (the timestamps must exactly match the time at which the game took place, as seen on the multiplayer lobby link).
    - As shown on the official livestream, in cases where the match is streamed. This may not be used if there is any doubt that the player's score did not decrease following the disconnect (i.e. before an ending diffspike).
12. Players are expected to keep the match running smoothly and without delays. Excessive match delays from the players' side may result in penalties being applied by the tournament organisers. Disrupting the match by foul play, insulting and provoking other players or staff, delaying the match, or other deliberate inappropriate misbehaviour are strictly prohibited, and will be punished accordingly.
13. All players and staff must be treated with respect. Instructions from the referees and the tournament organisers are to be followed. Decisions labelled as final may not be appealed.
14. Referees may allow, at their discretion, lower or higher tolerances for timers.
15. The tournament organisers may request liveplays or recordings of individual players or teams at any point in the tournament without prior warning.

## 4. Tournament registration

1. Every user interested in joining their country's team signs up individually.
   - The tournament organisers will create a list of potential candidates for a country's team.
   - The tournament organisers will elect one representative for each country with at least 3 players registered as the provisional captain for that team.
   - The provisional captain will receive a private message on Discord containing further instructions.
2. The provisional captain will form their team by selecting players from the candidate pool for their country.
   - Captains are expected to choose team members with honesty and good will, with the aim of fielding the strongest team possible.
   - Captains **MUST** submit their finalised team list before the deadline. Teams that fail to send a finalised team list before the deadline will be disqualified.
   - Captains are allowed to exclude themselves from the team list.
   - Captains are allowed to, and encouraged to, conduct and coordinate "tryouts", tests to gauge player aptitude, on their own terms.
   - Captains are allowed, at any time, to transfer their role to other prospective team members. Once given, only the new captain may assign the captaincy to another player.
   - Users responsible for organising their country's tryouts are encouraged to contact the tournament organisers to be elected as provisional captains for their team.
3. To ensure valid registrations, every prospective participant will go through [tournament screening](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Tournaments/Official_support#tournament-screening); violation of the [osu! community rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Rules) within the previous 12 months or an active tournament ban may void a player's eligibility to participate.
4. Tournament staff members are not allowed to play in the tournament, with the exception of commentators, streamers, and designers.
   - The tournament organisers must ensure that such staff members do not have access to any privileged data, e.g. qualifier score information, or mappool information before the mappool showcase.
